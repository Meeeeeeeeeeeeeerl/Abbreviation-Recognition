# Abbreviation-Recognizer-MVP (v0.1)
### *Goal of the MVP*
The goal of the MVP is to detect given abbreviations in a picture using OCR.
It is my hope that it can serve as a "Getting Started" to OCR technology and its use in the future.

### *Set-up*
1. Install the latest (stable) version of Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Clone the GitHub Repository 
3. Install PyTesseract (https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/ or https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki (recommended)) 
This is a Python Wrapper for the Google-OCR Tesseract (https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).
4. Install opencv-python (https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)
5. If you want to change the picture that will be analysed, go into the "img"-folder and change the "picture.png". 
6. Run the TextRecognizer.py
