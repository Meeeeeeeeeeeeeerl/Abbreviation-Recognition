somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me i aint the sharpest tool
in the shed she was looking kinda dumb with her finger and her thumb in
the shape of an | on her forehead well the years start coming and they
dont stop coming fed to the rules and i hit the ground running didnt make
sense not to live for fun your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
so much to do so much to see so whats wrong with being on the
backstreets you never know if you dont go you never shine if you dont
glow hey now youre an all star get your game on go play hey now youre a
rockstar get the show on get paid and all that glitters is gold only
shooting stars break the mold its a cool place and they say it gets colder
youre bundled up now wait till you get older but the meteor men beg to
differ judging by the hole in the satellite picture the ice skate is pretty
thin the waters getting warm so you might as well swim my worlds on fire
how about yours thats the way i like it and ill never get bored hey now
youre an all star get your game on go play hey now youre a rockstar get
the show on get paid and all that glitters is gold only shooting stars break
